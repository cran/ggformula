## Refining ggformula plots

If you are fussy about your plots, you may be wondering how to have more control over 
things like:

  * the colors, shapes, and sizes chosen when mapping attributes
  * labeling, including titles and axis labels
  * fonts, colors, and sizes of text
  * color of plot elements like background, gridlines, facet labels, etc.
  
As you can imagine, all of these things can be adjusted pretty much however you like.
This tutorial will introduce you to refining plots in `ggformula`.


## A quick anatomy lesson

Not biological anatomy, rather plot anotomy.  In order to talk about
plots, it is handy to have words for their various components.

 * A **frame** is the bounding rectangle in which the plot is constructed.  This  
 is essentially what you may think of as the x- and y- axes, but the plot isn't actually
 required to have visible "axes".
 
 * **glyphs** or **marks** are the particular symbols placed on the plot
 (examples: dots, lines, smiley faces, your favorite emoji, or whatever
 gets drawn).
 
 * Each glyph has a number of **attributes** or **properties**.
    * These always include position (you have to put them somewhere).
    * Other attributes incude things like size, color, shape.
    * Not all glyphs have the same attributes (points have shape, but
    lines do not, for example).
 
 * **facets** are coordinated subplots.
 
 * **scales** map raw data over to attributes of the plot.
 
 * **guides** go in the other direction and help the human map graphical
 attributes back to the raw data.  Guides include what you might call
 a legend, but also things like axis labeling.
 
 * **coordinates** are something like scales for positional attributes and 
 define the coordinate system for the frame.
 
 * **statistics** (stats) transform data before the plot is generated.  A common example
 is the use of `stat_bin()` to bin raw data before generating a histogram.

## Glyphs that use more than two positions

In addition to functions like `gf_histogram()` that require only a single position
variable and like `gf_point()` that require two, 
there are several `gf_` functions that require more than two position variables. 
How these positions are communicated via slots in the formula is described by the "shape" listed in the quick help for 
these functions.  


#### Exercise

Edit the code below to reveal the shape for some of the following:
`gf_linerange()`,
`gf_errorbar()`,
`gf_errorbarh()`,
`gf_ribbon()`,
`gf_crossbar()`.


```{r, multiple-variable-quickhelp, exercise = TRUE}
gf_pointrange()
```

#### Exercise
The `Temps` data set has temperature information for three cities for each day in
2013.  Edit the code below to use `gf_linerange()` or `gf_pointrange()`.  For a 
fancier plot, map the color to one of the three temperature variables.

```{r, ribbon-to-linerange, exercise = TRUE}
head(Temps, 3)
gf_ribbon(hi + lo ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps)
```

## Annotation

### Titles and axis labels

Plot titles and axis labels can be set using `gf_labs()`.  Text can be provied for 
`title`, `subtitle`, `caption`, and the positional attributes (`x` and `y`).

#### Exercise

Edit some of the labels of this plot as you see fit.  Notice that labels can be 
turned off by setting them to "".  (We'll learn how to improve the color scheme
shortly.)

```{r, labs-demo, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 3.5}
gf_linerange(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, 
             color = ~ mid) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Temperatures in three cities",
    subtitle = "2013 data",
    caption = "Data source: weatherData R package",
    x = "",  # hide labeling
    y = "Temperature (degrees F)"
  )
```

### Text and other labels

Arbitrary text can be placed on a plot using `gf_text()` or `gf_label()`.

#### Exercise

  1. Run the code below. 
  
  2. Then change `gf_text()` to `gf_label()` to see how these differ.
  
  3. Now change things so that the text or labels (your choice) are red.
  

```{r, labels, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 4.0}
# summary data used to create annotation
LabData <- Temps %>% group_by(city) %>%
  summarise(date = date[which.max(hi)],
            hi = max (hi), 
            description = paste("Highest Hi:", hi, "on", format(date)))

gf_linerange(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, 
             color = ~ mid) %>%
  gf_text((hi + 6) ~ date, data = LabData, 
          label = ~ description, size = 3) %>% 
  gf_labs(
    title = "Temperatures in three cities",
    subtitle = "2013 data",
    caption = "Data source: weatherData R package",
    x = "",  # hide labeling
    y = "Temperature (degrees F)"
  )
```


## gf_refine()

`gf_refine()` converts plot elements from native `ggplot2` into a form
that makes them chainable with `ggformula`.  Those familiar with `ggplot2`
can replace
```{r, refine1, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
p + foo(...)
```

```{r, refine2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
p %>% gf_refine(foo(...))
```

For those not already familiar with `ggplot2`, in the remainder of this tutorial, 
we illustrate some of the most common uses of `gf_refine()`.

## Controlling Scales

### How scales work

When we include `color = ~ mid` to out plot code, each value of the variable 
`mid` is assigned a color.  It is the job of the color scale to determine which 
values get mapped to which colors.  (A guide can be used so that humans can 
map back from colors to values when interpreting the plot.)
If we don't like the default color choices, we can tell R to use a different scale.

The situation is similar for other attributes (shape, size, fill, etc.), each of
which has its own scale.

### Color and fill

The colors in our temperature map have two problems. 

 * First, the differences are a bit subtle.
 * Second, the blues don't communicate "hot" very well.
 
We can fix this by selecting a scale for color.  This is done by 
passing the desired scale as an argument to `gf_refine()`, a general
purpose function for refining our plots.   

In the example below, we choose a rainbow of colors (and reverse the order) so
warmer temperatures have warmer colors.
`scale_color_gradientn()` creates a scale by interpolating between several colors --
in this case five colors selected using the `rainbow()` function.


```{r, scales, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 4.0}
gf_linerange(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, 
             color = ~ mid) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_colour_gradientn(colors = rev(rainbow(5))))
```

#### Exercise

You can also use `scale_color_gradientn()` with colors you enter manually.
Add a few colors between navy and red to make something more like the rainbow
colors above.

```{r, scales2, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 4.0}
gf_linerange(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, 
             color = ~ mid) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_colour_gradientn(colors = c("navy", "red")))
```

### Discrete colors

Discrete variables can also be mapped to colors.  If you want to determine which 
values are assigned to which colors, you can do this with `scale_color_manual()`

#### Exercise

Refine this plot using `scale_fill_manual()`.  Replace the three colors
in the example with three of your own choosing.
(Use `colors()` to list the possible color names.)


```{r, scales3, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 4.0}
gf_ribbon(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, 
          fill = ~ city, alpha = 0.6)  %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "orange")))
```

### ColorBrewer scales

ColorBrewer, by Cynthia Brewer, Mark Harrower, and The Pennsylvania State University,
is a collection of nice looking color palettes especially designed for use with
maps, but useful for many other purposes as well.

There are 3 types of ColorBrewer palettes, sequential, diverging, and qualitative.

  1. Sequential (`type = "seq"`) palettes are suited to ordered data that
  progress from low to high. Lightness steps dominate the look of these schemes,
  with light colors for low data values to dark colors for high data values.

  2. Diverging (`type = "div"`) palettes put equal emphasis on mid-range
  critical values and extremes at both ends of the data range. The critical
  class or break in the middle of the legend is emphasized with light colors and
  low and high extremes are emphasized with dark colors that have contrasting
  hues.
  
  3. Qualitative (`type = "qual"`) palettes do not imply magnitude differences
  between legend classes, and hues are used to create the primary visual
  differences between classes. Qualitative schemes are best suited to
  representing nominal or categorical data.

To use a ColorBrewer palette, select `scale_color_brewer()` for discrete
data or `scale_color_distiller()` for continuous data.  The latter interpolates
colors within one of the categorical palettes from ColorBrewer.

#### Exercise

Experiment with different colors by choosing different values for 
`type` and `palette`.

```{r, brewer, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 4.0}
gf_ribbon(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, fill = ~ city, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 2))

gf_linerange(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, color = ~ mid)  %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_distiller(type = "div", palette = 3))
```

### Adjusing other scales

Other scales work similarly.

## Coordinates

### coord_flip()

As the name suggests, `coord_flip()` reverses the roles of the x- and y-axes.  This is most useful for glyphs that `ggplot2` only provides in a "vertical" version,
such as boxplots and violin plots.

#### Exercise

Make horizontal violin plots by inserting `coord_flip()` into `gf_refine()`.
Change the plot to boxplots if you prefer those.

```{r, flip-violin, exercise = TRUE}
gf_violin(hi ~ city, data = Temps) %>%
  gf_refine()
```

### coord_equal()

When the x- and y-axes are on the same scale, it is sometimes good to 
force both scales to be rendered at the same size.  This also forces 
an identity line to have a true 45 degree slope.  

#### Exercise

Use `coord_equal()` to force equally-sized coordinate scales in the plot below.
```{r, coord_equal, example = TRUE}
gf_point(hi ~ lo | city, data = Temps, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) 
```

### coord_trans()

`coord_trans()` is used to construct scales with a transformation built in.

#### Example

The example below isn't very useful, but demonstrates two of the 
transformations that are available.  Find out more with `?coord_trans()`.

```{r, coord_trans, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(hi ~ lo | city, data = Temps, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_trans(x = "log", y = "sqrt"))
```

Built-in transformations include
`asn_trans()`, `atanh_trans()`, `boxcox_trans()`, `date_trans()`,
`exp_trans()`, `hms_trans()`, `identity_trans()`, `log10_trans()`,
`log1p_trans()`, `log2_trans()`, `log_trans()`, `logit_trans()`,
`probability_trans()`, `probit_trans()`, `reciprocal_trans()`,
`reverse_trans()`, `sqrt_trans()`, and `time_trans()`.
New transformations can be created using `trans_new()` in the 
`scales` package.


## Controlling the view

Often it is useful to limit or expand the view of the data presented in a plot.
There are three ways this can be done.

  1. Filter the data and build the plot only from the resulting (smaller) 
  data set.
  
  2. Use `gf_lim()` to set limits for the x- and y-axes.
  
  3. Use scales for x and y to set the limits.
  
In this section we will use a different data set.  `Galton` contains
data collected by Galton recording the heights of parents and sons.

```{r, Galton}
Galton %>% head(3)
gf_point(height ~ father, data = Galton) %>%
  gf_smooth(height ~ father, data = Galton, method = "lm")
```


### Filtering the data


```{r, filter, exercise = TRUE}
ShortDads <- Galton %>% filter(father <= 68)
gf_point(height ~ father, data = ShortDads) %>%
  gf_smooth(height ~ father, method = "lm") 
```


### gf_lims()


```{r, gf_lims, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(height ~ father, data = Galton) %>%
  gf_smooth(height ~ father, method = "lm") %>%
  gf_lims(x = c(NA, 68))
```


### Using scales to limit the view

```{r, scale_lims, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(height ~ father, data = Galton) %>%
  gf_smooth(height ~ father, method = "lm") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_x_continuous(limits = c(NA, 68)))
```


## Themes

### Using predefined themes

A number of predefined themes exist that control the appearance of non-data
elements of plots.  In this tutorial, we set the default theme using 

```{r, theme_bw, echo = TRUE}
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

Other themes include `theme_minimal()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_gray()`,
`theme_light()`, `theme_map()`, and `theme_quickmap()`.  The `ggthemes`
package includes some additional themes, including
`theme_economist()`, `theme_economist_white()`, `theme_excel()`,
`theme_fivethirtyeight()`, `theme_stata()`, `theme_tufte()`,
and `theme_wsj()`.  Many of these themes mimic the look of 
other software packages or of popular publications.

The theme can be set for an individual plot using `gf_theme()`.

#### Exercise

  1. Run the code below.
  
  2. Choose a different theme in place of `theme_fivethirtyeight()`
  
  3. Themes have optional arguments.  Try 
  `theme_fivethrityeight(base_size = 8)`.
  Experiment with different sizes and themes.

```{r, gf_theme, exercise = TRUE}
gf_ribbon(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, 
          fill = ~ city, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Themes can change overall look of a plot") %>%
  gf_theme(theme = theme_fivethirtyeight())
```

### Adjusting theme elements

Individual theme elements can also be adjusted.  

#### Exercise

Edit the code below to adjust theme elements. See `?theme` for details regarding
the elements and how to change them.

```{r, gf_theme_elements, exercise = TRUE}
gf_ribbon(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., data = Temps, 
          fill = ~ city, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Temperatures in Three Cities") %>%
  gf_theme(text = element_text(color = "red"), 
           plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
           axis.text = element_text(color = "goldenrod", face = "italic"))
```

```{r, q_theme, exercise = TRUE}
?theme
```

## Stats

Most often, users will have little need to adust the stat used to make layer of a plot since the 
default stat is usually what you need.  For example, the default stat for `gf_histogram()` is 
`stat_bin()`, which bins the data before plotting the rectangular bars.  So the following are 
equivalent.

```{r, histogram-stat, exercise = TRUE}
gf_histogram( ~ hi | city, data = Temps)
gf_bar( ~ hi | city, data = Temps, stat = "bin")
```

This also explains why the message reported when you create a historam without
setting `binwidth` is coming from `stat_bin`.  Notice that the stat can be
specified by a quoted string that names the part after `stat_` or it can be
specified by providing the function (potentially with optional arguments
included).

Other non-identity stats that get used with particular functions include

 * `stat_density()` gets used with `gf_density()` and `gf_dens()`
 * `stat_density2d()` gets used with `gf_density2d()`
 * `stat_count()` gets used with `gf_bar()` (`gf_col()` uses `stat_identity()`)
 
 Occasionally it is useful to use a non-default stat.  In particular, `stat_summary()` and
 `stat_summary_bin()` can be used to avoid common data transformation situations where
 a function is used to aggegrate over unique values of `x` or over bins of `x` values.
 
 
```{r, summary1, exercise = TRUE}
# Plot highest high temperature each month
gf_point(hi ~ (month(date, label = TRUE)), color = ~ city, data = Temps, 
         stat = "summary", fun.y = max) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "month", title = "Highest temperature each month in three cities") 
```

These stats are designed to work with `gf_linerange()` and `gf_pointrange()`, so three 
summary functions can be specified.  `fun.ymin` and `fun.ymax` return results that 
are available in `..ymin..` and `..ymax`.  

```{r, summary3, exercise = TRUE}
# Plot min, median, and max high temperature each month
gf_pointrange(hi + ..ymin.. + ..ymax.. ~ (month(date, label = TRUE)), color = ~ city, data = Temps, 
              position = position_dodge(width = 0.2),
              stat = "summary", 
              fun.y = median, fun.ymin = min, fun.ymax = max) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "month", 
          title = "Median, min, and max high temperature each month in three cities",
          caption = "jitter used to avoid overplotting") 
```
 
The default summary function is `mean_se` which
computes the mean, and the mean one standard errors added and subtracted.

```{r, mean_se, exercise = TRUE}
gf_pointrange(hi + ..ymin.. + ..ymax.. ~ (month(date, label = TRUE)), color = ~ city, 
              data = Temps, stat = "summary", position = position_dodge(width = 0.3)) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "month", caption = "mean +/- one SE")
```



We can create our own functions for use with `stat_summary`. The funcition is easiest 
to use if we write the function to take a vector `x` as input and to produce
a data frame with columns `y`, `ymin`, and `ymax`. Here is an example that creates a 
"3-number summary" that can be used to present the median and first and third 
quartiles.

```{r, three-number, exercise = TRUE}
median_quantiles <- function(x, central = 0.5, ...){
  data.frame(
    y = median(x, ...),
    ymin = quantile(x, 0.5 - central/2, ...),
    ymax = quantile(x, 0.5 + central/2, ...)
  )
}

gf_pointrange(hi + ..ymin.. + ..ymax.. ~ (month(date, label = TRUE)), color = ~ city, 
              data = Temps, stat = "summary", fun.data = median_quantiles,
              fun.args = list(central = 0.6),
              position = position_dodge(width = 0.3)) %>%
  gf_labs(x = "month", 
          title = "High temperatures by month in three cities",
          caption = "median and central 60% of data"
          )
```
