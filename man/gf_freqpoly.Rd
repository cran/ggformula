\arguments{
\item{object}{When chaining, this holds an object produced in the earlier portions
of the chain.  Most users can safely ignore this argument.
See details and examples.}

\item{gformula}{A formula with shape \code{~ x} or \code{y ~ x}.
Faceting can be achieved by including \code{|} in the formula.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.  Typically these are
(a) ggplot2 aesthetics to be set with \code{attribute = value},
(b) ggplot2 aesthetics to be mapped with \code{attribute = ~ expression}, or
(c) attributes of the layer as a whole, which are set with \code{attribute = value}.}

\item{alpha}{Opacity (0 = invisible, 1 = opaque).}

\item{color}{A color or a formula used for mapping color.}

\item{group}{Used for grouping.}

\item{linetype}{A linetype (numeric or "dashed", "dotted", etc.) or a formula used
for mapping linetype.}

\item{linewidth}{A numerical line width or a formula used for mapping linewidth.}

\item{binwidth}{The width of the bins. Can be specified as a numeric value
or as a function that calculates width from unscaled x. Here, "unscaled x"
refers to the original x values in the data, before application of any
scale transformation. When specifying a function along with a grouping
structure, the function will be called once per group.
The default is to use the number of bins in \code{bins},
covering the range of the data. You should always override
this value, exploring multiple widths to find the best to illustrate the
stories in your data.

The bin width of a date variable is the number of days in each time; the
bin width of a time variable is the number of seconds.}

\item{bins}{Number of bins. Overridden by \code{binwidth}. Defaults to 30.}

\item{center, boundary}{bin position specifiers. Only one, \code{center} or
\code{boundary}, may be specified for a single plot. \code{center} specifies the
center of one of the bins. \code{boundary} specifies the boundary between two
bins. Note that if either is above or below the range of the data, things
will be shifted by the appropriate integer multiple of \code{binwidth}.
For example, to center on integers use \code{binwidth = 1} and \code{center = 0}, even
if \code{0} is outside the range of the data. Alternatively, this same alignment
can be specified with \code{binwidth = 1} and \code{boundary = 0.5}, even if \code{0.5} is
outside the range of the data.}

\item{xlab}{Label for x-axis. See also \code{\link[=gf_labs]{gf_labs()}}.}

\item{ylab}{Label for y-axis. See also \code{\link[=gf_labs]{gf_labs()}}.}

\item{title, subtitle, caption}{Title, sub-title, and caption for the plot.
See also \code{\link[=gf_labs]{gf_labs()}}.}

\item{geom, stat}{Use to override the default connection between
\code{geom_histogram()}/\code{geom_freqpoly()} and \code{stat_bin()}. For more information
at overriding these connections, see how the \link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{stat} and
\link[ggplot2:layer_geoms]{geom} arguments work.}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This
can be used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and
improving the display. The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example,
to use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{show.help}{If \code{TRUE}, display some minimal help.}

\item{inherit}{A logical indicating whether default attributes are inherited.}

\item{environment}{An environment in which to look for variables not found in \code{data}.}
}
\value{
a gg object
}
\description{
Visualise the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing
the x axis into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.
Histograms (\code{geom_histogram()}) display the counts with bars; frequency
polygons (\code{geom_freqpoly()}) display the counts with lines. Frequency
polygons are more suitable when you want to compare the distribution
across the levels of a categorical variable.
}
\section{Specifying plot attributes}{


Positional attributes (a.k.a, aesthetics) are specified using the formula in \code{gformula}.
Setting and mapping of additional attributes can be done through the
use of additional arguments.
Attributes can be set can be set using arguments of the form \code{attribute = value} or
mapped using arguments of the form \code{attribute = ~ expression}.

In formulas of the form \code{A | B}, \code{B} will be used to form facets using
\code{\link[ggplot2:facet_wrap]{ggplot2::facet_wrap()}} or \code{\link[ggplot2:facet_grid]{ggplot2::facet_grid()}}.
This provides an alternative to
\code{\link[=gf_facet_wrap]{gf_facet_wrap()}} and
\code{\link[=gf_facet_grid]{gf_facet_grid()}} that is terser and may feel more familiar to users
of \pkg{lattice}.
}

\section{Evaluation}{


Evaluation of the \pkg{ggplot2} code occurs in the environment of \code{gformula}.
This will typically do the right thing when formulas are created on the fly, but might not
be the right thing if formulas created in one environment are used to create plots
in another.
