## Formula interface to ggplot2

`ggformula` introduces a family of graphics functions, `gf_point()`,
`gf_density()`, and so on, bring the formula interface to `ggplot()`. This
captures and extends the excellent simplicity of the `lattice`-graphics formula
interface, while providing the intuitive "add this component" capabilities of
`ggplot()`.
